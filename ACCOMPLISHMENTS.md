- **New Service**: Developed [AttendanceService](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/lib/services/attendance_service.dart#L7-L279) for API communication
- **New Provider**: Implemented [AttendanceProvider](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/lib/providers/attendance_provider.dart#L6-L286) for state management
- **New Widget**: Built [ClockWidget](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/lib/widgets/clock_widget.dart#L5-L351) for user interface
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive unit tests

### 2. Payroll Management System
- **New Model**: Created [Payroll](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/lib/models/payroll.dart#L2-L59) model for employee compensation data
- **New Service**: Developed [PayrollService](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/lib/services/payroll_service.dart#L7-L228) for payroll operations
- **New Provider**: Implemented [PayrollProvider](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/lib/providers/payroll_provider.dart#L6-L269) for payroll state management
- **New Widget**: Built [PayslipWidget](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/lib/widgets/payslip_widget.dart#L7-L555) for payslip viewing
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive unit tests

### 3. Enhanced Application Structure

- **Navigation**: Added payroll section to navigation drawer

### 4. Documentation & Testing
- **Specifications**: Created detailed [SPECIFICATIONS.md](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/SPECIFICATIONS.md)
- **Implementation Plan**: Developed comprehensive [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- **Project Summary**: Wrote extensive [PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)
- **Developer Guide**: Created detailed [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](file:///c%3A/Users/HI/Documents/deve%20local/flutterERP/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)
- **Model Tests**: Added unit tests for Attendance and Payroll models
- **README**: Updated project documentation
